# 🎨 Etch A Sketch Project

## 📝 Description
This project is a web-based version of the classic Etch A Sketch toy. Users can draw on the canvas using the arrow keys on their keyboard. They can also change the color of the drawing by selecting a color from the color picker. Additionally, there's a feature where users can grab and shake the frame to erase the canvas.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **HTML:** Used for structuring the web page.
- **CSS:** Used for styling the elements and layout.
- **JavaScript:** Used for implementing the drawing functionality, color picker, and grab-and-shake feature.

## 💡 Difficulties Faced
- **Changing Drawing Color Dynamically:** Understanding how to change the drawing color dynamically based on user input was a challenge. It required careful handling of color values and event listeners.
- **Implementing Grab-and-Shake Feature:** Implementing the grab-and-shake feature to erase the canvas required knowledge of mouse events and calculating movement distances. It involved tracking mouse movement and detecting a shaking motion.
