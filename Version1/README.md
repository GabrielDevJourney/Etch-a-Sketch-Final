## Introduction
Welcome to a simple solution to a etch a sketch challenge. This project provides a basic desmonstration of how a etch a sketch works.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS 
- JS

## Features
- Player can choose the size of the board.
- RGB color generating for each square.

## Process 
1. **Planning** : Understand first the project requirements

2. **Implemtntation** : Create the board and the button to choose the board size, then createad fucntion to colorized each square with random rgb color.

3. **Testing** : Seeing if the size of board wouldn't go above 100*100 squares, see if the colorize fucntion was working well.

## What I Learned 
Throughout the development of this project, I learned something new : 
- Generating random rgb color.
- To colorize something when hover.

## How It Could Be Improved
While the this project achieves its basic functionality, there are several areas where it could be improved:

- Better design (from responsiveness to visual appeling).
- Realistic etch a sketch usage.

## Usage
To use just choose the board size after can draw simply by hovering trough squares.

## Live Demo
